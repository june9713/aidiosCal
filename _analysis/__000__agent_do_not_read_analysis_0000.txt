# AidiosCal Project Analysis

## Project Structure Analysis
The project follows a typical web application structure:
- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `app/`: Core application code directory
- `static/`: Static assets directory
- `logs/`: Application logs
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `sql_app.db`: SQLite database file
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Key Components

### Backend
- Using a Python web framework (likely FastAPI/Flask)
- SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Structured logging system in place

### Frontend
- Static file serving capability
- Custom favicon.ico present
- Structured static assets directory

### Development Infrastructure
- Python package management via requirements.txt
- Local development database (sql_app.db)
- Logging system configured

## Initial Observations
1. The project appears to be a well-structured web application
2. Uses modern Python web development practices
3. Includes proper static file handling
4. Has database integration
5. Implements logging for debugging and monitoring

## Areas for Further Investigation
1. Database schema and relationships
2. API endpoints and routing structure
3. Authentication mechanism
4. Frontend technology stack
5. Logging configuration details

## Technical Debt / Concerns
1. Need to verify Python package versions in requirements.txt
2. Database file in version control (may need to be gitignored)
3. Cache files present (__pycache__)
4. Status of logging rotation/management

## Next Steps
1. Detailed code review of main.py
2. Database schema analysis
3. API endpoint documentation
4. Frontend code structure review
5. Logging system analysis
